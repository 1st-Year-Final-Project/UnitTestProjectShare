I didn't figure out how to include the second project/TestProject to source control so I just uploaded it separately.
You can download the ZIP file and unpack(!) it in folder of your choice.
Then open the ZPool solution in VisualStudio and richt click on the solution name:
Solution name > Add > Existing Project
Find the folder with the unpacked TestProject and select the .csproj file.
The test project shoul be added to you solution now. And hopefully works without adjustments.
